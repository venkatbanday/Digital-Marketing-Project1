# Digital-Marketing-Project1
A new product launch is around the corner. Being in the Digital Sales team and well connected with customers, you have been asked to create the buyer persona to whom this product will appeal the most.
The company wants to direct their marketing efforts to include a wide audience. However, would it be correct to assume that their product would appeal to everyone?
Not quite.
Even if your company's product does appeal to a wide audience, there are certain types of users you wouldn't want to attract. For example, users who enjoy the idea of your product but don't have the means to purchase it. This type of audience doesn't provide any sales value.
This project will help you to:
•	Draft both positive and negative personas
•	Reach out to the defined personas at different points throughout their Buyer's Journey
•	Gather sales intelligence to increase your sales
•	Utilize CRM Marketing Automation for a targeted campaign
•	Measure campaign effectiveness

Learners attempting this project are required to go through the first four sections (Introduction to Digital Selling - Beyond Social Selling, Developing Digital Selling Credibility, Digital Research and Developing Buyer Personas, and Turning Digital Connections in Sales Conversations) of the course before they start working on the solutions.
Project Goals/Objectives
•	Create a set of buyer personas and define attributes for each of them
•	For each buyer persona, identify the channels through which they could interact during the purchase cycle
